# **Eclipse-Jupyter-Notebook**

I read about the challenge called Space Apps 2023 - Eclipses: Perspective is Everything.
I went to [Nasa International Space Apps Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/challenges/eclipses-perspective-is-everything/?tab=details).

**SUMMARY**

Eclipses are awe-inspiring celestial events that drastically change the appearance of one of the two biggest objects we see in our sky: our Sun and Moon.
On Earth, people can experience eclipses when Earth, the Moon, and the Sun align. 
Your challenge is to create a game, activity, or story for young learners that explains the mechanics of eclipses,
including eclipse seasons, how and why eclipses occur, and why only some people on Earth can see an eclipse at a given time.

**OBJECTIVES**

Your challenge is to create an activity, game, or story (through words, art, video, graphic novel, or other artistic means) that explains the mechanics of eclipses.
Think about how your solution will answer the following questions:

- How do eclipses occur?
- Why do only some people on Earth see an eclipse at a given time?
- What causes the Sun, Moon, and Earth to align?
- How often do eclipses occur?
- How do scientists know when and where eclipses will occur?
- What is the difference between a lunar and solar eclipse?
- What is an eclipse season and why do they occur approximately every six months (or twice a year)?

Based on the objectives, I tried using Jupyter Notebook to answer the questions with data that was consulted in the resources that were available on the website itself.
